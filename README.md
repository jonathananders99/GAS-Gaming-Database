### Program Name: **_ODIN_ (Online Dynamic Information Network) Using GAS (Google Apps Script)**

### Description: 
This project was one of 3 databases I built for clients using GAS. This is the most recent of the 3 databases, and this is only the scripts used to run in the background. This does not include the Discord integration, or any other services included within the database. I included the templates used to create profiles as excel spreadsheets as visuals for how some of the google sheets look like. I also included another visual of the entire database from the script point of view in the UML file (which was made before I really knew what I was doing for technical documentation so it won't be very legible).

ODIN consists of over a thousand of hours of work and learning, and, to me, represents a passion project that I got to get paid to do. The only person doing the programming and everything else was me. The discord bot that handles interaction between the database and discord was writen by myself and one person from the clients group. The only other assistance I recieved in building this database was input from the client for initial creation and for their input during creation to help customize as much as possible to their wants and needs.

### How to run the project:
- This project is meant to be viewed and not used as there are a lot of necessary components missing. Without those missing components it makes it impossible to run any of these files. Those missing components are not included in this repository due to confidential information contained within them.
